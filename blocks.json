It is certainly a far cry from the flamboyance and all-out attacking intent of the Sir Alex Ferguson era.</p><p>Times, however, have changed and so have Manchester United.</p><p>Mourinho has not inherited an all-conquering force of former years. Management's arch-pragmatist happily flicked through his old tactical playbook at Liverpool and will make not a single apology for doing so.</p><ul><li><a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27163758'>What is the Manchester United way? An explanation</a></li><li><a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37685976'>Liverpool not the last wonder of the world - Mourinho</a></li></ul><p>For all the social media chatter and criticism from Liverpool fans, where Mourinho's crime appeared to be a refusal to allow Klopp's side to play in a manner in which they would win, United's manager was realism personified.</p><p>It was functional, not easy on the eye and brought predictable accusations that Mourinho had parked the bus. He will respond, with justification and a point in his pocket, that United came away with a draw at a place plenty will leave empty-handed this season.</p><p>United had only 35% possession, their lowest figure since statisticians Opta started compiling in 2003, although Mourinho returned to Anfield's media room after his main press briefing to dispute the finding, claiming they actually had 42% of the ball.</p><p>Juan Mata was confined to the bench, alongside Wayne Rooney, while Marouane Fellaini was back in midfield in a big, physical side designed to give United strength all over the pitch. </p><p>And man-of-the-match Ander Herrera was key in midfield, not giving Philippe Coutinho or Roberto Firmino any time or space. The Spaniard made 11 interceptions, the most by any Premier League player this season.</p><p>Mourinho deals in realism not romance. And this was a realistic approach - one United's fans who still crave the devil-may-care approach of the Ferguson era will have to get used to.</p><p>This was Mourinho's analysis, and it was as far removed from Ferguson's mantra as it was possible to get as he said: \"It is not the result we wanted but it is a positive result. It is a result that stops a direct opponent getting three points at home so not a bad result.</p><p>\"I think it was a positive performance. This is a point that stopped them winning three.\"</p>"}},{"renderType":"video","data":{"id":"37686429","media":{"externalId":"p04cc8c4","caption":"Man Utd's Jose Mourinho is back to his controlling best","entityType":"Clip","vpid":"p04cc8c6"}}},{"renderType":"html","data":{"payload":"<p>Former Old Trafford great Paul Scholes helped set the agenda for Manchester United's meeting with Liverpool by saying they have <a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37673302'>yet to form an identity</a> under Mourinho.</p><p>Ironically, United looked more like a Mourinho team against Liverpool than they have at any time since he arrived in the summer.</p><p>And yet there is weight to Scholes' observation.</p><p>The Portuguese manager has to find a formula to accommodate a squad that still looks to mix-and-match and which has yet to get the best out of £89m midfielder Paul Pogba, who was pedestrian again.</p><p>Pogba, the world's most expensive player, delivered one cross that provided United's best chance but which was headed badly off target by Zlatan Ibrahimovic.</p><p>Too often, though, Pogba either lost, or was knocked out of, possession too easily.</p><p>Zlatan himself, the ageing centrepiece of United's attacking plan, looked ponderous and off the pace and made a complete mess of their best opportunity, seemingly caught in several minds as he headed wide.</p><p>Mourinho has questions to answer before he will be able to present evidence of the identity Scholes desires, although this was a display of real steel and organisation.</p><p>It is not just Wayne Rooney's long-term future that is up for debate.
