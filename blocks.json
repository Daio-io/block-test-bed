Sometimes you need to run at people rather than around them - you need to put a bit of manners on them.'</p>  <p>Foley - or Axel to his mates - <a href='/sport/rugby-union/37672703.app'>died suddenly on Sunday in Paris</a> and the game in Ireland, and beyond, is going to take some time to try to comprehend this outrageous loss.</p>  <p>When the news broke you thought of his family, of course. You thought of all those people at his beloved Shannon RFC, where it all started for him. You thought of his legion of fans at Munster, who hold him up as one of their greatest and most influential sons.</p>  <ul>    <li><a href='http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04c6z0h'>Listen: Rugby mourns Ireland and Munster's Foley</a></li>  </ul>  <p>The numbers of his playing career are impressive - 201 appearances for Munster and 62 Tests for his country, 86 European ties, three European finals, three semi-finals. </p>  <p>No list of his accomplishments would be complete without cataloguing the five All Ireland League titles he won with Shannon. Those victories meant as much to him as anything. Hard rugby played in front of passionate rugby people. This was where Foley was at his happiest. It was what Foley was born to do.</p>  <p>And yet the number that jumped out at you on this grim day was 42 - his age. It's no age.</p>  <p>He had taken his first steps in coaching with Munster - he was head coach and in Paris for Munster's opening fixture of the Champions Cup against Racing 92 - and though he had a lot to learn, the story of his playing career told you emphatically that one day he would learn it all and achieve greatness as a coach, too.</p>"
